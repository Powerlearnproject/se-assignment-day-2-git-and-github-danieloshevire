## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that records changes to files or sets of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is particularly important in software development, where multiple people may work on the same codebase, and changes are frequent. 
 Why GitHub is Popular
1. Distributed Version Control: Every user has a complete copy of the repository, allowing offline access and collaboration.
2. Collaboration Features*: Tools like pull requests facilitate code reviews and discussions.
3. Community and Open Source: A large platform for sharing and contributing to projects.
4. Integrations: Works well with CI/CD tools and other services.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies complex Git operations for beginners.
6. Documentation: Extensive resources for learning and troubleshooting.
 Maintaining Project Integrity with Version Control
1. Change Tracking: Provides an audit trail for all modifications, enhancing transparency.
2. Reversion: Allows easy rollback to previous versions if issues arise.
3. Stable Collaboration: Manages branches and merges to prevent overwriting work.
4. Testing Isolation: Enables testing new features without disrupting the main codebase.
5. Documentation: Each commit can include explanations, aiding understanding and knowledge transfer.
6. Backup: Entire project history serves as a backup, protecting against data loss.
